Now I have finished copying the source code, then what I am going to do is
to learn how to use it.

The first thing to do is to understand the interfaces.

Because the http server has to behave differently according to different requests, the inner
data structure is set to be a map whose key is a regular expression. And the data structure matches the
regular expression, and leads us to a function dealing with this kinds of requests.

Then, I need to learn how to use a regular expression.
I can dive into the test code to get some example.
